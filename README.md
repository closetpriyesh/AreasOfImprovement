Efforts to make myself strong in areas which require improvements

- XPath axes
  - Main DOC referred: [https://www.guru99.com/xpath-selenium.html](https://www.guru99.com/xpath-selenium.html)
  - Practiced several xpath axes like descendant, ancestor, parent, following, preceding, following-sibling, preceding sibling etc. on websites
  - Added some in demo automation project as well (XPath axes and TestNG annotations)
- Order of log levels
  - Main DOC referred:
    - [https://www.guru99.com/xpath-selenium.html](https://www.guru99.com/xpath-selenium.html)
    - [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/log4j/log4j\_logging\_levels.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/log4j/log4j_logging_levels.htm)
    - [http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-logging/levels.html](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-logging/levels.html)
  - Recalled the log levels and understood the importance of the order
  - Implemented a sample project including log4j appenders (Logging)
- TestNG annotations
  - Main DOC referred:
    - [https://www.javatpoint.com/testng-annotations#:~:text=TestNG%20Annotation%20is%20a%20piece,of%20execution%20of%20test%20methods.](https://www.javatpoint.com/testng-annotations#:~:text=TestNG%20Annotation%20is%20a%20piece,of%20execution%20of%20test%20methods.)
    - [https://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html](https://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html)
  - Recalled all the TestNG annotations
  - Implemented the same and understood the flow and importance of each annotation (XPath axes and TestNG annotations)
- Multiple inheritance
  - Spend some time absorbing the idea
  - Added one simple example demonstrating the same (Multiple inheritance)
- Maven commands
  - DOC referred: [http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html](http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html)
  - Created a simple maven project with basic tests (MavenHelloWorld)
  - Executed all standard phases of default lifecycle (validate, compile, test, package, verify, install, deploy), clean lifecycle and few associated goals as well
  - Analyzed the outcome
  - Integrated plugins
  - Learnt about packaging
- SQL joins
  - Revised SQL joins
  - Learnt and practiced on SQLBolt and hackerrank
  - Attached screenshots for POC at [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y3mw-qeUZTA8s3p6JDiHNz7S8pGKTbm0?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y3mw-qeUZTA8s3p6JDiHNz7S8pGKTbm0?usp=sharing)
  - Will continue to learn advanced topics and practice more!
